    "title": "The latinr package lets you create and submit presentations to LatinR",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introducing: latinr, the R package\nIn this edition of LatinR we showcase a new way of submit presentations entirely from your R session!\nThe aim is to make the whole process of creating, formatting and submitting your work as easy as possible. With the latinr package you can write your presentation using R Markdown adding the submission details in the header, compile it to PDF using the conference template and then submit it without the need of filling any form.\nNote that none of this is at all mandatory. If you don’t feel comfortable using R Markdown, you can use whatever other tool you enjoy to create your PDF, and if you prefer, you can always use the EasyChair web interface to submit your work.\nAlso note that article submission is somewhat experimental at the moment, which means that if you do use it, go to the EasyChair website to be certain that your submission is correct.\n\nCreating LatinR submissions with latinr\nFirst things first, you need to install the package using devtools::install_github(\"latinr/latinr\").\nIf you use RStudio, you can create an R Markdown template by going to File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown -&gt; From Template and selection “LatinR submission article”. There, you can name your file, select its folder and then press OK to create a base file you can begin to complete.\nYou’ll notice that all the submission details are handled by the header. You can complete them there or the function latinr::latinr_wizard() to launch a graphical user interface that will guide you through the process and finally show you a valid header that you can copy and paste into your file.\n\n\n\nlatinr wizard\n\n\nAlternatively you can use the wizard and click “Save” (on the top-right corner) to create the same base file but pre-populated. In any case, the R Markdown file should look something like this:\n\n\n\nlatinr file skeleton\n\n\nThe first chunk performs some basic checks on the metadata each time the file is rendered. We recommend to leave it there so that any error comes to light as soon as possible. The rest is the R Markdown demo document. You can “knit” it to test that you’ve got the proper LaTeX installation and then start writing your presentation for LatinR!\n\n\nSubmitting an article with latinr\nSo far, latinr allows you to create a correctly anonymised PDF following the conference template. You can send it manually through the EasyChair website or, if you like, using latinr.\nIn any case, you’ll need to sing up at EasyChair. Then, you can optionally save your login details using lating::latinr_password_set(), which will promt you for your username and password. This is not mandatory but can make things easier. You might need to install que keyring package, in which case you’ll get an informative error.\nFinally, the submission is done with latinr::latinr_submit(). By default it checks if there’s a single .Rmd file in the current working directory and, if it finds it, takes it as the file to be submitted. Then, it will should you the submission details so you can check that everything is correct, it then renders and shows you the resulting PDF so you can also verify it, and finally it performs the submission.\nOptionally, in case you have a PDF created by any other medium, you can pass its path as an argument and use the .Rmd only to populate the submission details.\nAs we said before, this process is somewhat experimental an integration with web forms is notoriously complex. For that reason, it is of the utmost importance that you go to the EasyChair website to ascertain that your submission has gone through correctly. In the event of any error, you can always correct them manually.\n\n\nAbsolutely optional\nEach step of the process is completely optional. You can use latinr to create and submit your work, only to create it, only to submit it, or not at all. Do whatever makes you more comfortable!\nBut if you do use latinr and find any error o have any suggestion, then don’t hesitate to contact us! The best way is by opening an issue on the GitHub repository or sending us a message through our Slack, or you can email the package maintainer with packageDescription(\"latinr\")$Maintainer. This is all new to us and we wish to leverage the community to improve it for the future!"

In this edition it will be possible to participate with oral presentations, lightning talks and posters. \n\nTopics\nThe suggested topics for this edition are the following:\n\nApplications of R in different disciplines of academy and industry. All fields of knowledge and their combinations are welcome.\nNew packages development.\nInnovative use of existing R packages.\nUse of R in teaching\nInnovative initiatives for learning R\nExperiment design using R\nReproducible research with R\nMachine learning with R\nData visualization with R\nNetwork analysis with R\nUses of R in government and public services\nUse of R for open data analysis\nUse of R with other programming languages and platforms \n\n\n\nYou can register using eventbrite at this link selection the corresponding ticket.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of submissions\n\nOral presentations\nPresentations about results of research projects, developments or initiatives that, due to their originality or potential application and impact on the use or development of R in academia or industry, are of interest to the regional R community. Those who participate in this modality will have 20 minutes for the presentation and 5 minutes for Q&A. \n\n\nLightning Talks\nLightning talks provide an opportunity to present and discuss advances, ideas, ongoing research, experiences and challenges related to LatinR’s topics. Those who participate in this modality will have 5 minutes for the presentation. Lightning talks will be grouped into thematic sessions that will include a final round of Q&A. \n\n\nPosters\nLike Lightning Talks, the posters provide an opportunity to present progress and ongoing projects related to LatinR’s topics. During the conference there will be a time block for the presentation of posters and dialogue with the audience. \n\n\n\nSubmitting a proposal\n\nAll the proposals will have to be submitted as a PDF, without authors’ names nor their affiliations, letter sized document, typed using a font size 11 and single line spacing. Maximum 2 pages.\nThere is a package developed by Elio Campitelli that allows you to create the abstract as an R Markdown file. You can see the details here. In previous editions, it was possible to send the abstracts directly from RStudio; however, due to changes with the previous platform (EasyChair), we will be using a new one (Open Review) and the automated submission won’t be available.\n\nIf you prefer using a different text editor, we kindly ask you to use this template.\n\nThe submissions will be accepted via the Open Review platform. You will have to register before hand. Please, do this as soon as you can, as the account activation on Open Review can take up to 24 hours.\nFor those sending proposals authored by more than one person, only one of them has to sign up on Open Review.\nYou can only submit one proposal as the main author, but you are welcome to contribute as the co-author of two other submissions.\nAll the submissions will be carefully reviewed by the Scientific Committee (soon to be announced), considering their originallity, contributions, quality and clarity. \n\n\n\nKey dates\nSubmission deadline: June 30th, 2023\nAcceptation notice: early August 2023"

This hackathon was organized by the LatinR team in conjunction with the ReproHack community ♻️.\nThere were two ways of participation in the hackathon: (1) As an author: sending your article so participants try to reproduce it on the day of the event. (2) Attending the hackathon: Those who participated were able to learn from the experience of trying to get back the results and leave comments to the authors.\nIn a relaxed atmosphere, we met people from Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay, Peru, Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Spain and the United Kingdom to spend an afternoon sharing information on reproducibility and working on the articles.\nDuring the hackathon we had 4 talks (in Spanish!) that were recorded on a special playlist on the LatinR YouTube channel and you can access them here.\n\n\n\nTalks\n\n\nMaëlle Salmon and Miguel Alvarez in turn recorded two videos representing the ROpenSci community. The videos were shown on the day of the event, and Anna Krystalli, founder of ReproHack and also editor of ROpenSci, answered live questions.\nParticipating in the organization (in alphabetical order): Juliana Benitez, Florencia D’Andrea, Anna Krystalli, Daniela Gawehns, Priscila Minotti, David Pérez-Suárez and Roxana Villafañe.\n\n👩‍💻 Do you want to know more about ReproHack?\nHere is some information of interest about this community and computational reproducibility (in English):\n\nAnna Krystalli - UseR 2020\nChallenge to scientists: does your ten-year-old code still run?\n\n\n👉 Join the ReproHack Slack!\n\nReproHack team (In alphabetical order): Florencia D’Andrea, Daniela Gawehns, Anna Krystalli, Linda Nab, Riccarda Propart and Paloma Rojas-Saunero.\nWe thank the RSE group of the University of Sheffield and The Software Sustainability Institute for supporting ReproHack."

The in-person event in that city will be reschedule for 2021, on a date to be announced before the end of the year.\nOne of our goals in organizing LatinR has always been bringing together the Latin American R community, learning from the developments and research of its members, and generating bonds of collaboration and friendship. We do not want to lose that this year. In moments like these, having the opportunity to share with the community becomes even more valuable. That is why we have decided to organize an online activity on the dates when the conference was originally planned (October 7-9). We are still ironing out the characteristics of the event, so we hope to announce during the next weeks both the details of this activity, and the modes of participation.\nIn the meantime, take care.\nSee you (virtually) in October!\nLatinR 2020 organizing team"

    "title": "Paquete latinr para crear y enviar trabajos a LatinR",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Presentando: latinr, el paquete\nEn esta edición de LatinR estrenamos una nueva forma de enviar trabajos enteramente desde la sesión de R!\nLa idea es facilitar lo más posible todo el proceso de creación, formato y envío de trabajos. Con el paquete latinr podrán escribir la presentación con R Markdown agregando los detalles en el header, compilar a PDF usando el estilo de la conferencia y enviarlo sin tener que llenar ningún formulario.\nEs importante aclarar que usar el paquete no es obligatorio en absoluto. Quien no se sienta cómode con R Markdown puede usar cualquier herramienta que quiera para crear su PDF y quien prefiera usar la inferfaz web de EasyChair, puede hacerlo sin problema.\nUna segunda aclaración es que el envío de trabajos mediante el paquete todavía es un poco experimental, por lo que les pedimos que si lo usan, vayan a la web para cerciorarse de que todo haya salido correctamente.\n\nCómo usar latinr para crear trabajos a LatinR\nLo primero de todo es, por supuesto, instalar el paquete. Esto pueden hacerlo con el comando devtools::install_github(\"latinr/latinr\").\nSi usan RStudio, pueden ir a Archivo -&gt; Nuevo Archivo -&gt; R Markdown -&gt; Desde Plantilla y ahí seleccionar “LatinR submission article”. Ahí ponen el nombre de su presentación y la carpeta dónde quieren crearla y al darle OK se les creará un archivo base que pueden empezar a completar.\nVan a ver que todos los datos de envío van en el encabezado del archivo. Pueden llenarlos a mano pero más fácil es usar el “wizard” con la funcion latinr::latinr_wizard(). Eso les ve a llevar a una interfaz gráfica donde pueden llenar sus datos y que al final les va a mostrar un encabezado yaml válido para copiar y pegar en su archivo.\n\n\n\nlatinr wizard\n\n\nAlternativamente pueden usar el wizard y darle al botón “Save” en la esquina superior derecha y eso les va a crear el mismo archivo base pero con los datos completados. En cualquier caso, el archivo R Markdown les va a quedar algo así:\n\n\n\nlatinr file skeleton\n\n\nEl primer chunk del documento chequea que la metadata esté más o menos correcta cada vez que se renderiza el archivo. Recomendamos no editarlo para que cualquier error salga a la luz lo antes posible. El resto es el documento de R Markdown de prueba. Pueden tratar de “knitear” este archivo de prueba para estar seguro que su instalación de LaTeX está en orden y luego comenzar a preparar su presentación para LatinR!\n\n\nCómo enviar el artículo\nHasta acá latinr les permite crear un PDF con la plantilla de la conferencia y correctamente anonimizado para el envío. Pueden enviar ese PDF manualmente entrando a la página de EasyChair, pero si quieren, pueden hacerlo usando latinr.\nEn cualquier caso, van a tener que hacerse una cuenta en EasyChair. Luego, tienen la opción de guardar sus datos de cuenta latinr::latinr_password_set(), que les va a pedir su usuario y su contraseña. Esto no es obligatorio pero facilita las cosas. Es posible que necesiten instalar el paquete keyring, en cuyo caso, les saldrá un error informativo.\nFinalmente el envío se realiza con latinr::latinr_submit(). Por default se fija si hay un único archivo con extensión .Rmd en su directorio de trabajo y, si así es, lo toma como el archivo a enviar. Luego, les muestra los detalles del envío para asegurarse de que esté todo bien, luego renderiza y muestra el archivo PDF para también asegurarse de que haya renderizado correctamente y finalmente hace el envío.\nOpcionalmente, si tienen el PDF renderizado de otro lado, pueden usar un .Rmd con el encabezado únicamente para los detalles (como el título, los nombres de les autores, etc…) y pasarle la ruta al archivo PDF que quieren enviar.\nComo dijimos antes, este proceso es relativamente experimental y la integración con formularios web es siempre complicada. Por eso, es muy importante ir a la página de EasyChair para chequear una última vez que todos los datos se hayan cargado correctamente y que el archivo haya sido subido bien. En caso de que haya algún problema, pueden corregirlo manualmente en la página.\n\n\nAbsolutamente opcional\nCada parte de todo este proceso es completamente opcional. Pueden usar latinr para crear y enviar su trabajo, sólo para crearlo, sólo para enviarlo o no usarlo en absoluto. ¡Hagan lo que les haga sentir más cómodes!\nPero si usan latinr y encuentran algún problema o tienen alguna sugerencia, ¡no duden en contactarnos! La mejor forma es abriendo un issue en el repositorio en GitHub o mandando un mensaje en nuestro Slack, o pueden enviarle un mail al maintainer del paquete usando packageDescription(\"latinr\")$Maintainer. Todo este proceso es nuevo para nosotros también y ojalá que con la comunidad podamos mejorarlo aún más!"

Es necesario registrarse en ella para poder hacer el envío. Es importante tener en consideración que el registro no es automático; puede tomar hasta 24 horas en quedar habilitada la cuenta. Se sugiere no dejar la creación de la cuenta para el último minuto.\nEn el caso de los trabajos con autoría compartida, basta con que una persona del equipo se haya registrado en Open Review.\nEs posible enviar un solo trabajo como autor/a principal. Sin embargo, es posible participar como co-autor/a en otros dos trabajos.\nTodos los trabajos serán revisados cuidadosamente por los miembros del Comité Científico (a anunciar próximamente), teniendo en cuenta su originalidad, aporte, calidad técnica y claridad.\n\n\n\n\nFechas importantes\nInicio recepción de trabajos: 2 de mayo de 2023\nFecha límite para la recepción de propuestas: 30 de junio de 2023\nNotificación resultados evaluación: principios de agosto 2023\n\nPresentaciones y pósters versiones anteriores\nEn nuestro canal de YouTube es posible revisar los videos de las ediciones 2020 a 2022 de LatinR.

Reprogramaremos para 2021 la edición de la conferencia en esa ciudad, en una fecha que esperamos poder anunciar antes de fin de año.\nUna de nuestras motivaciones para organizar LatinR ha sido siempre la posibilidad de reunir a la comunidad Latinoamericana de R, aprender de los desarrollos e investigaciones de sus integrantes, y generar lazos de colaboración y amistad. No queremos perder eso este año. En momentos como los que estamos viviendo, tener la oportunidad de compartir con la comunidad se vuelve algo más valioso aún. Es por eso que hemos decidido organizar una actividad en línea en las fechas en las que originalmente estaba planeada la conferencia (7-9 de octubre). Aún estamos definiendo las características del evento, así que esperamos anunciar durante las próximas semanas tanto los detalles de esta actividad, como las modalidades de participación.\nMientras tanto, cuídense mucho.\n¡Nos vemos (virtualmente) en octubre!\nEquipo organizador LatinR 2020"

Leonardo Collado Torres coordinó el blog post. Este blog post fue originalmente publicado en el blog del R Consortium el 7 de julio del 2020.\nEl 19 de junio de 2020 filmamos un video para useR!2020 donde resaltamos las comunidades y organizaciones en América Latina en las que estamos involucradxs o que tienen participantes latinxs. En este blog post, queremos destacar estas iniciativas y recordarle a todxs que estamos más que dispuestxs a ayudarles a empezar organizaciones similares en sus comunidades locales.\n\n\nLatinR: LatinR es una conferencia internacional trilingüe para el uso de R en la investigación y desarrollo en América Latina. Desde 2018, nuestra conferencia ha sido un punto de partida para nuevos paquetes, nuevos grupos de usuarixs locales, clubes de lectura, capítulos de R-Ladies, traducciones y otras iniciativas en la región.\nConectaR: ConectaR 2019 tuvo lugar del 24 al 26 de enero de 2019 en la Universidad de Costa Rica, en San José, Costa Rica. Fue el primer evento en Centroamérica avalado por la R Foundation, y se realizó completamente en español. Puedes encontrar más información aquí.\nsatRday: satRday es una conferencia sobre R y sus aplicaciones, que ocurre en todo el mundo, y que cuyos eventos son organizados por la comunidad local. Tuvimos dos eventos de satRdays en América Latina: en Santiago - Chile y São Paulo - Brasil. Si quieres organizar un evento de satRday en cualquier lugar en América Latina, ¡por favor ponte en contacto para que nos podamos ayudar mutamente!\nR-Ladies: R-Ladies es una organización global que promueve la diversidad de género en la comunidad R. Actualmente, tiene 123 capítulos activos en 51 países de todo el mundo, de los cuales en América Latina tenemos 49 capítulos en 10 países. Algunxs latinxs son parte del equipo global de R-Ladies, incluyendo su directiva. COVID-19 no ha detenido a R-Ladies. En cambio, hemos migrado nuestros eventos en línea y hemos creado alianzas entre los diferentes capítulos. Todo ha sido en un esfuerzo para proveer opciones para aprender R en ambientes seguros y de apoyo para así aumentar la diversidad de género en la comunidad de R. ¡Únete!\nrOpenSci: R para ciencia abierta, rOpenSci, brinda revisiones técnicas gratuitas de paquetes en R para mejorar la calidad del software de código abierto para maximizar legibilidad, facilidad de uso, utilidad y minimizar la redundancia. Su proceso de peer-review será prontamente traducido al español, ¡tú puedes involucrarte!\nCDSB: la Comunidad de Desarrolladores de Software de Bioinformática nació en 2018 con el objetivo de ayudar a usarixs de R latinxs en convertirse en desarrolladores de R & Bioconductor, además de aumentar la visibilidad de latinxs en estas comunidades. Para mayor información de la CDSB revisa bit.ly/cdsbpost2020 (en español).\nRUGs: hoy en día exiten varios Grupos de Usuarios de R (RUG en inglés) en América Latina, algunos de los cuales son oficiales y patrocinados por el R Consortium. La creación de un espacio acogedor y con buena onda es crucial para que las ideas fluyan. Esto no sólo asegura que todos se sientan cómodos aprendiendo y compartiendo lo que han aprendido, sino que también permite que aparezcan nuevos proyectos inesperados. ¡Te podemos ayudar a empezar tu propio grupo!\nR4DS en español + el paquete datos: los recursos para aprender R en inglés son muchos, increíbles, en línea y gratuitos. Pero en América Latina pocas personas pueden darse el lujo de aprender inglés, y los recursos en español son pocos. Para ayudar a resolver este problema, como comunidad tradujimos del inglés al español el libro “R for Data Science” y desarrollamos un paquete con la traducción de todos los datos que se usan en el libro: datos. El flujo de trabajo para contribuir al paquete fue diseñado para involucrar a quienes quieran contribuir por primera vez, y ahora está guiando el desarrollo de una versión en portugués que se lanzará en los próximos meses.\n#DatosDeMiércoles + #30díasdegráficos: La cuenta de Twitter @R4DS_es fue creada como una forma de compartir proyectos como la traducción de R4DS y para desarrollar iniciativas para ir creciendo la comunidad de R de habla hispana, tales como #datosdemieRcoles, el primo latinoamericano de #TidyTuesday. La idea no es solo utilizar conjuntos de datos en español, sino también conjuntos de datos que sean relevantes para las personas de nuestra Región. Esta iniciativa ha sido complementada por un desafío dataviz de 30 días llamado # 30díasdegráficos. Si deseas participar proponiendo un conjunto de datos para #datodemiéRcoles, visite nuestra cuenta de github.\nThe Carpentries: The Carpentries desarrolla capacidades esenciales globales en datos y habilidades computacionales para llevar a cabo una investigación eficiente, abierta y reproducible. La construcción de una comunidad sostenible y activa en América Latina incluye varias iniciativas: traducción de lecciones, capacitación de instructores, coordinación de talleres y recaudación de fondos. Ponte en contacto a través de la lista de correo y en el Slack de Carpentries, canal carpentries-es.\nReproHack: ReproHack es una comunidad que está creciendo, conformada por investigadores que están luchando contra la crisis de reproducibilidad al compartir sus experiencias de diferentes disciplinas. Se enfoca en organizar hackathones donde los participantes intenta reproducir un artículo de investigación publicado a partir de una lista de artículos propuestos, que tengan los datos y el código público. Estamos planificando el primer Reprohack en español para octubre de este año y puedes ponerte en contacto a través de Twitter.\nAI Inclusive: AI Inclusive es una organización que promueve la diversidad en la Comunidad de Inteligencia Artificial (IA; AI en inglés). Queremos crear conciencia sobre los problemas de Inteligencia Artificial y empoderar a la comunidad para que puedan ingresar en el campo de la IA, un campo que no es para nada diverso. En Diciembre 2019, tuvimos nuestros eventos de lanzamiento en Río de Janeiro, Brasil y San Francisco, California. Juntos, estamos construyendo una comunidad para hacer que la Inteligencia Artificial sea más inclusiva para todxs. ¡Síguenos y únete a nosotrxs!\nData Latam: en mayo del 2016 arrancamos con el primer podcast de Data Latam con el objetivo de ofrecer a gente interesada un punto de acceso fácil y en español al mundo de la ciencia de datos. Siempre le preguntamos a lxs entrevistadxs “¿cómo llegaste a donde estás?”, y la diversidad de historias ha sido enorme. Hoy en día Data Latam es una comunidad Latinoamericana de profesionales y académicxs aplicando ciencia de datos en su día a día. ¡Te invitamos a participar!\n\nLo que pasa en la comunidad R, no se queda en la comunidad R. Todas las buenas prácticas de comunidades inclusivas y diversas aprendidas en muchas de las iniciativas presentadas anteriormente, generan equipos de trabajo fuertes dentro de la comunidad R y fuera de ella. Aún hay mucho que hacer, pero lo que ya hemos logrado es muy alentador y provee bases muy sólidas para el futuro.\nEstas iniciativas son sostenidas por muchas personas que hacen un gran esfuerzo detrás de escena, que es principalmente voluntario. Algunos de los desafíos que enfrentan las comunidades se traducen en múltiples aspectos positivos, sostenidos y mucho trabajo duro invisible. Algunos son: buscar financiamiento internacional porque el financiamiento regional es limitado, traducir contenido, unir fuerzas a través de organizaciones, organizar conferencias regionales, convertirse en desarrolladores de la tecnología.\nLa comunidad de R en América Latina está creciendo rápidamente y también la responsabilidad de hacer que este crecimiento sea sólido y seguro. Algunos de los trabajos futuros que nosotrxs, como constructores de la comunidad, esperamos cumplir son: consolidar las conferencias regionales con el apoyo de patrocinadores internacionales; adquirir apoyo para mantener los proyectos de traducción; amplificar la voz de las minorías regionales; importar material educativo y oportunidades de trabajo; conectar a expatriadxs con sus comunidades locales; ayudar a otros grupos como los RUGs y RLadies; colaborar con otras iniciativas como R-Forwards, Africa-R, MiR, entre otras; aumentar nuestra representación y la de otras minorías en el R Core Team, la R Foundation y el R Consortium.\n¡Muchas gracias!

    "text": "LatinR2020 &lt;- Latin American Conference about the Use of R in Research + Development\n \nThis 2020 LatinR keeps on wantering through the contintn. This year, the third edition of the confernece will take place in Montevideo, Uguruay October 7th through 9th 2020. Following previous schedules, it will consist of a first day for workshops and two days for the conference proper.\nIn this first announcement we outline topics of interest, presentation guidelines and important dates for proposal submission.\n\nTopics of interest\nSuggested topics for this edition are\n\nApplications of R in academic and industrial disciplines. All fields of knowledge and their combinations are of interest (e.g., Data Science, Statistics, Informatics, Biological and Health Sciences, Bioinformatics, Geology, Atmospheric Sciences, Social Sciences, Humanities, Education, Economy, Data Journalism, etc…)\nApplications of R together with other programming languages\nR packages development\nInnovative uses of existing R packages\nUses of R in education\nInnovative initiatives in the reaching of R\nReproducible research using R\nBig data and R\nMachine learning and R\nR visualization tools\nOpen data analysis with R\n\n\n\nPresentation guidelines\n\nOral presentations\nCommunications about research results, progress reports, or specific developments that, because their originality or potential applications in the use or development of R in academia or industry, is of interest to the regional community of R users. Presenters will have 15 minutes + 5 minutes for Q&A.\nSubmissions must include a summary of no more than two pages including text, tables and figures. For the case of projects including Shiny applications or other interactive formats, they must also include the URL in which the application is available.\n\n\nPosters/Lightning talks\nPosters allow researchers and professionals to present and discuss their latest advances, ideas, ongoing research, and experiences or challenges related to the topics of interest of LatinR. Presenters should choose between poster format or a 5 minutes lightning talk.\nSubmissions must include a summary of no more than two pages including text, tables and figures.\n\n\nRound tables\nRound tables bring together researchers and professionals to present different viewpoints about a common topic. Proposals must consider one moderator and between 3 and 4 presenters.\nThe format will be as follows. First, a five minute introductory presentation by the moderator. Since LatinR gathers people from a great variety of disciplines, this introduction is meant to familiarise the audience with the particular topic of the round table. It should also explicitly state the connection of each presenter to the topic. Then, each presenter will have a maximum of 15 minutes. At the end, there will be 15 minutes for Q&A with the audience.\nWe are particularly interested in lineups that include presenters from diverse backgrounds (different institutions, countries, areas of research, gender, etc…) and show different methodologies and approaches to the subject.\nSubmissions must include:\n\na general description of the round table with 150 word limit.\na summary of each presentation with a one page limit including text, tables and figures.\n\n\n\n\nImportant dates\nAbstract submission start: March 2nd 2020\nAbstract submission deadline: May 30th 2020\nAbstract acceptance notification: July 2020\nAbstract final version submission and author registration deadlines: July 2020\nLatinR 2020: October 7th through 9th 2020\n\n\nSubmission guidelines\n\nThe official languages of the conference are Spanish, Portuguese and English.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cross-posted:\nThis useR!2020 session and video was organized by Laura Acion, Yanina Bellini Saibene, Paola Corrales, and Paloma Rojas Saunero. Leonardo Collado Torres coordinated the blog post submission. This blog post was originally submitted to the R Consortium blog and published there on July 7th 2020.\nOn June 19th 2020 we filmed a video for useR!2020 showcasing the communities and organizations we are involved in that are for Latin Americans or have Latin American participants. In this blog post, we wanted to highlight these initiatives and remind everyone that we are more than happy to help you launch similar initiatives in your local communities.\n\n\nLatinR: LatinR is a trilingual international conference on the use of R in research and development across Latin America. Since launching in 2018, our annual meetings have been a starting point for new packages, local user groups, reading clubs, R-Ladies chapters, translations, and other initiatives in the region.\nConectaR: ConectaR 2019 took place during January 24-26, 2019 at the University of Costa Rica, in San José, Costa Rica. It was the first event in Central America endorsed by The R Foundation, and it was held completely in Spanish. You can find more information here.\nsatRday: satRday is a conference about R and its applications, that happens all over the world, and it is organized by the local community. Two satRdays events happened in Latin America: in Santiago - Chile and São Paulo - Brazil. If you want to organize a satRday anywhere in Latin America, please get it touch so we can help each other!\nR-Ladies: R-Ladies is a global organisation that promotes gender diversity in the R community. It has 123 active chapters in 51 countries around the world, of which 49 are found across 10 Latin American countries. Some Latin Americans are part of the R-Ladies Global Team, including its leadership. COVID-19 has not stopped us, instead, we have migrated online and fostered alliances among different chapters. All in an effort to give gender minorities in the R community the opportunity to learn R in a safe and supportive environment. Join us!\nrOpenSci: R for open science, rOpenSci, provides free technical review of R packages to improve the quality of open source software in order to maximize readability, usability, usefulness, and minimize redundancy. Their peer-review process will soon be translated to Spanish and you can get involved!\nCDSB: the Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers (CDSB in Spanish) was born in 2018 with the goal of helping Latin American R users become R & Bioconductor developers and increase the representation of Latinx in these communities. For more information about CDSB check bit.ly/cdsbpost2020.\nRUGs: there are several R User Groups in Latin America, some of which are officially sponsored by the R Consortium. We believe that creating a welcoming space is crucial for keeping the ideas flowing, which allows for meaningful networking and, consequently, the development of new projects. We can help you start your own group!\nR4DS in Spanish + datos package: the resources to learn R in English are many, awesome, online, and free. But in Latin America few people can afford to learn English, and the resources in Spanish are few. To help solve this problem, we community-translated to Spanish the “R for Data Science” book and developed a package with the translation of all the datasets used in it: datos. The workflow to contribute to the package was designed to engage first-time contributors, and is now guiding the development of a new version in Portuguese that will be released in the next few months.\n#DatosDeMiércoles + #30díasdegráficos: The @R4DS_es Twitter account was created as a way to share projects like the R4DS translation and to develop initiatives to foster the Spanish-speaking R community, like #datosdemieRcoles, the Latin American cousin of #TidyTuesday. The idea is not only to use datasets that are in Spanish, but also datasets that are relevant for our Region. This initiative has been complemented with the 30 days plot challenge #30díasdegráficos. If you want to participate proposing a dataset for #datodemiéRcoles, please visit our github repo.\nThe Carpentries: The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. Building a sustainable and active community in Latin America includes several initiatives: lesson translations, instructor training, workshop coordination, and fundraising. Get in touch with us through the mailing list and the carpentries-es channel at the Carpentries Slack workspace.\nReproHack: ReproHack is a growing community for researchers that are fighting the reproducibility crisis by sharing their experiences across disciplines. It is focused on organizing hackathons where participants attempt to reproduce published research from a list of proposed papers with public code and data. We are planning the first ReproHack in Spanish for October 2020 and you can get in touch with us through Twitter.\nAI Inclusive: AI Inclusive is an organization that promotes diversity in the AI Community. We want to bring awareness around Artificial Intelligence issues and empower the community so they can enter in the AI field, a field that is not diverse at all. In December 2019, we had our launch events in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and San Francisco, California. Follow us and join us!\nData Latam: in May 2016 we started with the first Data Latam podcast, aimed at offering an easy entry point, in Spanish, to those interested in data science. We always ask our interviewees: “How did you get where you are?”, and the diversity of stories has been enormous. Today Data Latam is a Latin American community of professionals and academics, who apply data science in their day to day work and we invite you to participate!\n\nWhat happens in the R Community doesn’t stay in the R Community. All the good practices of inclusive and diverse communities learned in several of the initiatives presented before, generate strong work teams within and beyond the R community. There is still a lot to be done, but what we’ve already achieved is very encouraging and provides a solid foundation for the future.\nThese initiatives are sustained by many people making a great, mostly volunteer, effort behind the scenes. Some of the challenges that the communities face are translated into multiple positives, sustained, and a lot of invisible hard work. Some of them are: finding international funding due to limited local options, translating content, joining forces across organizations, organizing regional conferences, and becoming active developers of the technology.\nThe Latin American R community is growing fast and so does the responsibility to make this growth solid and safe. Some of the future work that we, as community builders, look forward to fulfilling are: consolidating regional conferences with support of international sponsors; acquiring funding to sustain translations; amplifying the voices of regional minorities; importing educational material and work opportunities; connecting expats with their local communities; helping other groups such as RUGs and RLadies; connecting with other initiatives such as R-Forwards, Africa-R, MiR, among others; Increase our and other minorities representation in the R Core Team, the R Foundation, and the R Consortium.\nThank you! Please watch our useR! 2020 video on YouTube."

    "text": "By Allison Horst, Curtis Kephart, and Yanina Bellini\nCross-posted:\n\n\n\nBirds of a Feather banner for RStudio::conf(2020)!\n\n\nThe “Birds of a Feather” (BoF) sessions at the 2020 RStudio Conference were a place where R-users with similar backgrounds, interests, and aspirations could connect in a low-stress social setting. In other words - these sessions let “birds of a feather flock together.” Building on the 2019 conference swag, we rolled out a bunch of new BoF buttons for rstudio::conf 2020.\nHere we’ll share the process for how some of the designs were created, including several that truly involved a flock of contributors (names for groups of birds are from Bird Spot).\n\nWell, what can we realistically fit on a 1.5” button?\nThe cool and challenging thing about designing the BoF buttons was the size restriction. In a 1.5” button, we wanted to create designs that:\n\nReflect the group name and/or community\nInclude at least one bird\nAre obviously distinguishable for each group\nAdd some readable text\nOh also, all while setting an approachable tone.\n\nIt turns out the answer to “What can you fit on a 1.5” button?” is…actually quite a lot. Here are a few of the designs:\n\n\nData science team leaders\nFeaturing 80’s beach volleyball sandpiper coach leading a team of R users:\n\n\n\nFun fact: a group of sandpipers can be called a fling or a bind.\n\n\nNatural language processing\nFeaturing a wordy bird - a parrot!\n\n\n\nFun facts: Groups of parrots are sometimes called companies, a prattles, or pandemoniums. Also, parrots are the only birds that can use their feet (like hands) to serve themselves food. And one more thing - the text in the background of this design is a line from Patrick Rothfuss’ The Name of the Wind (one of artist @allison_horst’s favorite books).\n\n\nThe spatially aware carrier pigeon…\n…checking flight routes before setting off on their next delivery:\n\n\n\nFun fact: A group of pigeons is sometimes called a kit or a loft.\n\n\nCommunity-driven designs\nSeveral of the designs - especially R-Latin America, R-Africa, and R-Ladies - depended on recommendations, insights, and feedback from multiple members of those communities. Here, we’ll highlight elements and contributors of several community-driven designs.\n\nR-Latin America\n\n\n\nThe R-Latin America BoF button was truly a collaborative effort, with every detail - from bird to branch - created based on ideas and input from R-Latin America community members. Massive thanks to the R-Latin America design contributors (and thank you to @yabellini for providing this compiled list & text):\nLaura Ación, Marcela Alfaro, Yanina Bellini, Juliana Benitez (expert ornithologist!), Elio Campitelli, Paola Corrales, Florencia D’Andrea, Natalia da Silva, Priscilla Minotti; Riva Quiroga, Vilma Romero, Gabriela Sandoval, Heather Turner; and the LatinR Conference Community!\nThese contributors are from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Perú, Uruguay and the UK, and belong to R-Ladies Chapters and R User Groups in these countries. The final picture was chosen for the vote of the broader LatinR Conference Community.\nHere are some insights into the final design elements:\n\nThe bird species is the chingolo (Zonotrichia capensis) which was chosen because it seemed to be the bird that is native to many Latin American countries, and is also unique to Latin America. It was one of a number suggested by ornithologist Juliana Benitez!\nThe chingolo is standing on a tilde (“~”) branch, used in letter eñe (ñ)\nThe color bands on the tilde represent colors on flags for Latin American countries\nThe shape of Latin America is represented on the bird’s chest\nThe bright green background is a nod to the astonishing biodiversity in Latin America\n\n\n\nAfricaR\n\n\n\nThe AfricaR BoF button was designed with suggestions and feedback from AfricaR community leaders Shelmith Kariuki and Dennis Irorere.\nSome design elements for the AfricaR button:\n\nThe colors (orange, purple and black) are borrowed from (and inspired by) the existing Africa R Users hex design\nThe shape of the continent is in orange (and outlined by data points, with a ggplot-inspired background grid)\nThe ostrich was suggested by Shelmith and Dennis as a representative bird\n\n\n\nR-Ladies\n\n\n\nThe R-Ladies BoF button started with an idea from R-Ladies founder Gabriela de Quiroz, who suggested a gull as a nod to both R-Ladies’ beginnings in San Francisco, and to this year’s conference location!\nWith feedback from Gabriela and the R-Ladies leadership team including Laura Ación and Erin LeDell, and RStudio’s Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, the final design features the following elements:\n\nA flock (or colony) of gulls, species chosen because it’s common to San Francisco, where R-Ladies began!\nThe gulls are riding an updraft of air together\nThe purple-to-black gradient is inspired by the R-Ladies color scheme\n\n\n\nThe whole collection\nThis year, there were 24(!) different Birds of a Feather buttons. When we put them all together, here’s the flock for the 2020 conference (with more planned for next year):\n\n\n\nWe hope that everyone can find a bird that they relate to, and we look forward to meeting many of you at future RStudio Conference BoF sessions!\nSo, just one final question: Which bird(s) are you?"
